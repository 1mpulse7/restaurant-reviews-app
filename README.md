# Udacity Restaurant Reviews project
---

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This was a project assigned by the Udacity front-end nano-degreee. The object of the project was to take a
restaurant reviews website and make it responsive on all screens, while also achieving accessibility standards.
A secondary objective was to implement a service worker to cache the files of the site in a way so that the site will be available offline if previously visited.

### To view the project

To view the project you will need to have python installed on your machine. If you're going to run
the project on a mac, then python will come preinstalled. If the machine you're on is running windows,
then follow these instructions : "https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/pythoneclipsejava/python.html".
Once you have python installed, clone the github repository with the project to your machine.
Navigate to the folder with your terminal and launch a python server with the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000". This will launch a server hosting the project. The last step is to go to your favorite browser, and type in "localhost:8000" into the url bar. This will bring up a version of the site that you can view and play with.

### Resources used for project

For a lot of the project, I googled small solutions to problems as they arose. However for getting started and for understanding the service worker I used Mathew Crawford's, walkthrough blog, Doug Brown's tutorial, and "Service Workers: and Introduction" by Matt Gaunt.
